As a long-history editor, emacs lacks some "modern" features established by
other "modern" editors, among which [[http://www.sublimetext.com/][sublime]] is one of the most famous and
popular. To tell the truth, the minimap and smooth-scrolling looks really
charming and attractive. There're various attempts trying to bring these
features to emacs, such as [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MiniMap][minimap.el]], but none of them work perfectly.

[[https://github.com/zk-phi/sublimity][sublimity]] is just another attemp, it's not perfect, however, IMHO, it's better
than others.

After installing sublimity, type =M-x sublimity-mode= to enable it.

  (defun ome-sublimity-setup ()
    (require 'sublimity-scroll)
    (require 'sublimity-map))

  (ome-install 'sublimity)
#+END_SRC
